# TODO: Python Semantics

## Description

TOD: So  for my project I wanted to explain some of the semantics in python as a comparision to a lot of the semantic topics that we went  over in class, and how they relate, or differ. So one thing to note that when doing research for this project it is important to know where programing languages come from; Scala is a programing language that was written in Java, and relies on the Java vertual machine or JVM for its run time. Now Java as a programing language is written in C like most modern programing languaes, so in a sense you could say that Scala is writtne in C but with some extra steps. Python is also written in C, so as one might image scala and python do have some similarities on their semantics.

    Some similarities of these lanagues would be duck typing, both Scala and Python use duck typing as a way of writting code, I go more in depth on this topic in my video. Variable types in both scala and python include, objcts, functions, and variables. I take this one step further in the video to demonstrate that even file types can be used as a variable when importing classes from a file. Another sematic that I went over for python that is absent in scala are variable types and their mutable types. In Python any variable say 'a' can be inilized as a type int, in python and then be converted to a type string, object or any other type. This shows some  flexability in the variable types from the python programing language. I also breiley went over mutable and immutable type in Python like list which are mutable and tuple which are immutable, meaning they cannot be changed. Another type that is immutable that I forgot to go over in my video is strings, you cannot change the value types of a string in python.

    Other topics that I went over in the video were on abstract classes another topic that we also covered in class. But just to briefly restate some of that stuff here an abstract class, is a class that has one or more abstract methods; an abstract method is a method has a declaration but not an implemenation. Abstract class will also have a decleration but not an immplementation as well or else an erro will be through. So child class of the abstract class can be made though. The reason for this round about way of making a child of an unsable class goes comes down to the 'is a' expression of a child object class. So in the example I did the abstract class was Vechical, and its child was a car; so a car 'is a' vechile. but with this example a vechile could kind of be anything and you could not define all possible atracbuts for all other types of possible children for a vechile class for example how many wheels a vechile might have, so it is made as a place holder to help coders get started with some methods and a basic frame work where they can make more specialisezed and usable children of abstract class vechile.
